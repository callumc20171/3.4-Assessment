                	<h3>
	                	OBHS has been running senior basketball programs for over 20 years and has competed for the local dunedin title every year.
                	</h3>
                	<p>
                	    Under head coach Brent Matehaere OBHS has only lost the dunedin title once in the programs history. Furthermore, the school reguarly attends the NZ Basketball Secondary Schools national "AA" tournament where in 2014 OBHS came first outbeating all other teams in New Zealand to win the title.
                	</p>
                	<p>
                	    The 2020 season marks head coach Matehaere's 22nd season teaching at the school.
                	    During this time he has won the local Dunedin tournament 19 times only losing in 2014 where the team bounced back to win the national title. To start off the 2020 season Matehaere coached the Otago Nuggets NBL team leading them to the title and earning coach of the year in the process.
                	    The whole school showed their support for the Nuggets team by wearing white shoes resembling the ones worn in the finals game.
                	</p>
                	<h4>
                	    While the 2020 nationals were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, the team is hopeful to continue the streak of local tournament wins and continues to push towards reaching next years national tournament.
