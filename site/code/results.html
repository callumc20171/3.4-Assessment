                        OBHS Started off slow struggling to pull away from a relentless SBHS team who consistently found ways to score against the OBHS defence. It took until the 4th quarter for OBHS to finally prove themselves as they began to show their dominance outscoring SBHS with 31 4th quarter points.

                        An unfortunate injury to starter Angus Henderson saw him watching from the sidelines while both teams continued to fight on. OBHS were able to hold off a strong first half performance from WBHS as they lead by 2 points going into the break. The third quarter saw OBHS dominate Waitaki outscoring them by 20 points 33-13 and giving a 22 point breathing room. WBHS attempted to get back at OBHS with a strong 4th quarter but were held off.
